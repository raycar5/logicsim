# logicsim

Create and simulate digital circuits with rust abstractions!

In logicsim you use a [GateGraphBuilder](TODO) to create and connect logic gates,
conceptually the logic gates are represented as nodes in a graph with dependency edges to other nodes.

Inputs are represented by constants([ON], [OFF]) and [levers](GateGraphBuilder::lever).

Outputs are represented by [OutputHandles](OutputHandle) which allow you to query the state of gates and
are created by [GateGraphBuilder::output].

Once the graph is initialized, it transforms into an [InitializedGateGraph] which cannot be modified.
The initialization process optimizes the gate graph so that expressive abstractions
that potentially generate lots of [constants](GateIndex::is_const) or useless gates can be used without fear.
All constants and dead gates will be optimized away and the remaining graph simplified very aggressively.

**Zero overhead abstractions!**

## Examples
Simple gates.
```rust
let mut g = GateGraphBuilder::new();

// Providing each gate with a string name allows for some very neat debugging.
// If you don't want them affecting performance, you can disable feature "debug_gates",
// all of the strings will be optimized away.
let or = g.or2(ON, OFF, "or");
let or_output = g.output1(or, "or_output");

let and = g.and2(ON, OFF, "and");
let and_output = g.output1(and, "and_output");

let ig = &g.init();

// `b0()` accesses the 0th bit of the output.
// Outputs can have as many bits as you want
// and be accessed with methods like `u8()`, `char()` or `i128()`.
assert_eq!(or_output.b0(ig), true);
assert_eq!(and_output.b0(ig), false);
```

Levers!
```rust
let l1 = g.lever("l1");
let l2 = g.lever("l2");

let or = g.or2(l1.bit(), l2.bit(), "or");
let or_output = g.output1(or, "or_output");

let and = g.and2(l1.bit(), l2.bit(), "and");
let and_output = g.output1(and, "and_output");

let ig = &mut g.init();

assert_eq!(or_output.b0(ig), false);
assert_eq!(and_output.b0(ig), false);

// `_stable` means that the graph will run until gate states have stopped changing.
// This might not be what you want if you have a circuit that never stabilizes,
// like 3 not gates connected in a circle!
// See [InitializedGateGraph::run_until_stable].
ig.flip_lever_stable(l1);
assert_eq!(or_output.b0(ig), true);
assert_eq!(and_output.b0(ig), false);

ig.flip_lever_stable(l2);
assert_eq!(or_output.b0(ig), true);
assert_eq!(and_output.b0(ig), true);
```

[SR Latch!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR_NOR_latch)
```rust
let r = g.lever("l1");
let s = g.lever("l2");

let q = g.nor2(r.bit(), OFF, "q");
let nq = g.nor2(s.bit(), q, "nq");

let q_output = g.output1(q, "q");
let nq_output = g.output1(nq, "nq");

// `d1()` replaces the dependency at index 1 with nq.
// We used OFF as a placeholder above.
g.d1(q, nq);

let ig = &mut g.init();
// With latches, the initial state should be treated as undefined,
// so remember to always reset your latches at the beginning of the simulation.
ig.pulse_lever_stable(r);
assert_eq!(q_output.b0(ig), false);
assert_eq!(nq_output.b0(ig), true);

ig.pulse_lever_stable(s);
assert_eq!(q_output.b0(ig), true);
assert_eq!(nq_output.b0(ig), false);

ig.pulse_lever_stable(r);
assert_eq!(q_output.b0(ig), false);
assert_eq!(nq_output.b0(ig), true);
```

## Debugging

Currently there are 2 debugging tools:

### Probes

Calling [GateGraphBuilder::probe](todo) allows you to create probes, which will print the value of all of the bits provided
along with their name whenever any of the bits change state within a [tick](todo).

### Example:
```rust
let mut g = GateGraphBuilder::new();

let l1 = g.lever("l1");
let l2 = g.lever("l2");


let or = g.xor2(l1.bit(), l2.bit(), "or");
let xor = g.xor2(l1.bit(), l2.bit(), "xor");
g.probe(&[or,xor],"or_xor");
let xor_output = g.output1(xor, "xor_output");


let ig = &mut g.init();
assert_eq!(xor_output.b0(ig), false);

ig.set_lever_stable(l1);
assert_eq!(xor_output.b0(ig), true);

ig.set_lever_stable(l2);
assert_eq!(xor_output.b0(ig), false);

ig.reset_lever_stable(l1);
assert_eq!(xor_output.b0(ig), true);

ig.reset_lever_stable(l2);
assert_eq!(xor_output.b0(ig), false);
```
In the terminal you'll see:
```sh
or_xor: 3
or_xor: 1
or_xor: 3
or_xor: 0
```

### .dot files

Using the method [InitializedGateGraph::dump_dot](todo) you can generate [.dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))
files which can be viewed in many different graph viewers. I recommend [gephi](https://gephi.org/), many others can't handle the size of the graphs
generated by logicsim.

For example here is the graph representation of the [8 bit computer example](#the-8-bit-computer):

If we zoom in a bit we can see each node is labeled with it's name which can help debug really nasty optimization bugs.

## The 8 bit computer

In the examples folder you'll find a very simple 8 bit computer it's a great showcase of what you can achieve by using rust's constructs
to create modular circuit abstractions.

You can play with it in only 3 shell commands! ([Assuming you have cargo installed](https://rustup.rs/)).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/raycar5/logicsim
cd logicsim
cargo run --release --example computer greeter
```

## Built in circuits

The `circuits` module features a lot of useful pre-built generic components, check them out [here](todo).

## Next steps

- Better debugging: I want a gui where I can see many outputs at once with logic-analyzer-like features, probably web based.
- More thorough optimization testing and debugging: I have documented and tested a lot of the public API surface but the optimizations folder
needs some love.
- Risc-V: I want to test out the limits of logicsim by implementing a Risc-V core and running rust programs in it!
- Compiling: Right now logicsim is just an interpreter, I might try making it compile circuits to either rust or x86_64 directly.
- Synthesizing: I have a nice fpga dev kit next to me and it would be pretty cool if I could synthesize circuits built in logicsim into it.
